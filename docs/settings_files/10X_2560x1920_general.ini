[Image_Metadata]
# Species, Magnification and Fixed_Field are used as metadata
# Scale value is in (pixel / micrometer). This value needs to be accurate
# in order to have correct results.
Species: Sheep
Magnification: 10X
Fixed_Field: 2560x1920
Scale: 2.1

[Threshold_Params]
# Values are in pixels
# Block_Size must be an odd integer
# If there is speckling in the airspaces, try increasing the Block_Size
# Alternatively, try increasing the Constant.   
Block_Size: 251
Constant: 0

[Morphology_Params]
# Values are in pixels
# increase Min_Alveolar_Size if you are capturing too many holes in the tissue
# increase Speckle_Size if too many black spots appear in thresholded image
Min_Alveolar_Size: 500
Max_Speckle_Size: 100
