[Image_Metadata]
# Species, Magnification and Fixed_Field are used as metadata
# Scale value is in (pixel / micrometer). This value needs to be accurate
# in order to have correct results.
Species: Species
Magnification: 20X
Fixed_Field: 2560x1920
Scale: 4.23

[Threshold_Params]
# Values are in pixels
# Block_Size must be an odd integer
# If there is speckling in the airspaces, try decreasing the Block_Size
# Alternatively, try increasing the Constant (although this may result in blank images).
# Available Methods are 'mean', 'median', or 'gaussian'    
Block_Size: 1005
Constant: 0
Method: mean

[Morphology_Params]
# Values are in pixels
# Try adjusting these values first
# increase Min_Alveolar_Size if there are too many holes in the tissue, this setting 
#    removes objects smaller than the specified size
# increase Max_speckle_Size if large speckles appear in your image, this setting
#    removes black speckles smaller than the specified size
Min_Alveolar_Size: 2735
Max_Speckle_Size: 405
